<p>A traditional alignment chart uses a 2-axis grid to describe 9 moral alignments:  </p>
<p>Good - Evil<br>Lawful - Chaotic </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it is difficult to take alternative moral perspectives seriously when some of them are labeled as &quot;good&quot;.  </p>
<p>Everyone thinks of themselves as good: we rationalize that our past actions (which we cannot change) fit some definition of &quot;good&quot; (which we can change).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Paladins are good at following laws, Demons are good at getting what they want, and Devils are good at both.  </p>
<p>The Fay races have a more thorough understanding of consequentialist ethics, and their Chaotic morality is not simply the opposite of following laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of including Good in the alignment chart, consider the remaining labels as 3 independent axes:  </p>
<p>Lawful: &quot;The means justify the ends&quot;<br>Chaotic: &quot;The ends justify the means&quot;<br>Evil: &quot;The ends justify themselves&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This 3-axis space has 8 quadrants which we can visualize as 2 political compasses:  </p>
<p>Neutral (Druids)<br>Lawful (Paladins)<br>Evil (Demons)<br>Lawful Evil (Devils)<br>Chaotic (Pixies)<br>Chaotic Lawful (Faeries)<br>Chaotic Evil (Gremlins)<br>Lawful Chaotic Evil (equivalent to neutral) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By combining the neutral categories, we get a chart with 6 familiar alignments, 1 new alignment, and more meaningful tradeoffs for characters who cannot claim to be simply Good. </p>

<p>This 3-axis system maps neatly onto traditional depictions of winged creatures:  </p>
<p>Lawful: bird wings<br>Evil: bat wings<br>Chaotic: butterfly wings</p>
