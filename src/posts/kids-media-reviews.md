## Video Games

Our favorite family-friendly video games with no realistic violence and no microtransactions.

I have played through all of these with my 4-6 year old kid.
Many are co-operative, some are single-player and we can trade off with the easier and harder parts, or treat it like a "choose your own adventure" interaction.

## Mobile Games

It can be difficult to identify mobile games that are actually games, instead of addictive gambling apps.

Check the available in-app purchases.  
If it has purchases for "remove ads" or "unlock extra levels", then it is a normal game.  
If it has purchases for "buy X gems for $X.99" then it is addictive gambling.  
Sadly this rules out most "hidden object" games.

Some very good apps are only available by subscription.  
Always subscribe for the shortest time period. The savings for a 1-year subscription are meaningless if the kid loses interest after 1 month.
