> Good \- Evil  
> Lawful \- Chaotic

> But it is difficult to take alternative moral perspectives seriously when some of them are labeled as "good"\.  
>   
> Everyone thinks of themselves as good: we rationalize that our past actions \(which we cannot change\) fit some definition of "good" \(which we can change\)\.

> For example, Paladins are good at following laws, Demons are good at getting what they want, and Devils are good at both\.  
>   
> The Fay races have a more thorough understanding of consequentialist ethics, and their Chaotic morality is not simply the opposite of following laws.
> Fairies experience time backwards\. They remember the future but can only guess at the past. That means that their ethics must be based on a superhuman understanding of consequences. If a fairy wants something that is not constantly guarded, then they can take it when it is not guarded. If a fairy wants something from you, and can convince you that you are getting a good deal in exchange, then they can offer you that deal. They already know whether they will have to follow through or not.


> Instead of including Good in the alignment chart, consider the remaining labels as 3 independent axes:

> Lawful: "The means justify the ends"  
> Chaotic: "The ends justify the means"  
> Evil: "The ends justify themselves"

> This 3\-axis space has 8 quadrants which we can visualize as 2 political compasses:  
>   
> Neutral \(Druids\)  
> Lawful \(Paladins\)  
> Evil \(Demons\)  
> Lawful Evil \(Devils\)  
> Chaotic \(Pixies\)  
> Chaotic Lawful \(Faeries\)  
> Chaotic Evil \(Gremlins\)  
> Lawful Chaotic Evil \(equivalent to neutral\)

> By combining the neutral categories, we get a chart with 6 familiar alignments, 1 new alignment, and more meaningful tradeoffs for characters who cannot claim to be simply Good\.

> Lawful: bird wings  
> Evil: bat wings  
> Chaotic: butterfly wings
